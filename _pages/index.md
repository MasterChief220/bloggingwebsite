I am a dedicated cybersecurity engineer focused on expanding my expertise in pentesting and security operations center (SOC) practices. I rank in the top 2% on TryHackMe while actively pursuing knowledge in ethical hacking and data science. My diverse skill set spans ethical hacking, data science, 2D animation, coding (Python, C++, MySQL, assembly), and tools like Adobe After Effects, Solidworks, and AutoCAD.
